## Beginner 2

Create a program that checks if a word is a [palindrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)â€”that is, a word which is spelled the same when its letters are reversed, such as "noon" or "racecar". Capitalization of letters isn't important. Just check if the letters would be the same if reversed.

```
> Noon
Palindrome
> racecar
Palindrome
> Groot
Not a palindrome
```
