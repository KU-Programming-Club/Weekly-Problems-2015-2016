This problem comes from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/), a neat website filled with mathematically-oriented programming challenges. This problem is actually [problem 16](http://projecteuler.net/problem=16) from Project Euler in disguise, so if you're so inclined, you can create a Project Euler account, submit your solution, and earn points! Yeah!

Anyway, your goal is to find the sum of the digits of a rather large number. For example, 2^15 = 32678, so the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26. What is the sum of the digits of 2^1000? 2^10000? 2^100000?
