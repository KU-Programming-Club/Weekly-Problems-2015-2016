# Week 3

## Beginner - Letters in Alphabetical order
__*Source*__: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3h9pde/20150817_challenge_228_easy_letters_in/

A handful of words have their letters in alphabetical order, that is nowhere in the word do you change direction in the word if you were to scan along the English alphabet. An example is the word "almost", which has its letters in alphabetical order.<br>
Your challenge today is to write a program that can determine if the letters in a word are in alphabetical order.<br>
As a bonus, see if you can find words spelled in reverse alphabetical order.<br>
<br>
#### Input description
You'll be given one word per line, all in standard English. Examples:
```
almost
cereal
```

#### Output Description
Your program should emit the word and if it is in order or not. Examples:
```
almost IN ORDER
cereal NOT IN ORDER
```
<br>
#### Sample Input
```
billowy
biopsy
chinos
defaced
chintz
sponged
bijoux
abhors
fiddle
begins
chimps
wronged
```

#### Sample Output
```
billowy IN ORDER
biopsy IN ORDER
chinos IN ORDER
defaced NOT IN ORDER
chintz IN ORDER
sponged REVERSE ORDER
bijoux IN ORDER
abhors IN ORDER
fiddle NOT IN ORDER
begins IN ORDER
chimps IN ORDER
wronged REVERSE ORDER
```

## Intermediate 1 - Linked List Addition
__*Source*__: Cracking The Coding Interview (5th Edition)

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a
single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is
at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns
the sum as a linked list.

#### Sample Input
```
List A: 7 -> 1 -> 6
List B: 5 -> 9 -> 2

That is, 617 + 295.
```

#### Sample Output
```
2 -> 1 -> 9.
```

## Intermediate 2 - Hyperbinary Computation
__*Source*__: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2xx86n/20150302_challenge_204_intermediate_its_like/

Imagine that instead of having just the two digits 0 and 1, the binary number system
had three digits, 0, 1 and 2 with everything else working exactly the same. This
system is known as the "hyperbinary number system". <br>

Lets see an example how the hyperbinary number system works. Lets take the
hyperbinary number "1021", and try and figure out what number it represents.
ust as before, each position represents a power of 2, but now you can have 0,
1 or 2 of each of them, so the calculation goes like this:

<br>
1 \* 2 <sup>3</sup> + 0 \* 2<sup>2</sup> + 2 \* 2<sup>1</sup> + 1 \* 2<sup>0</sup><br>
= 8 + 2 \* 2 + 1<br>
= 8 + 4 + 1<br>
= 13
<br>

Interestingly, this is not the only way you can represent the number 13 in hyperbinary, you could also write 13 as "221" and "1101".<br>

In fact, this is a common issue with this number system: most numbers can be written in multiple ways in hyperbinary. Your challenge today is to find every single hyperbinary representation of a given number.

#### Input
The input will be a single line containing a single number (written in regular decimal).

#### Output
Your program should print out all possible representations of the input number
in hyperbinary, one per line. Every representation should be printed out once
and only once. The order of the outputs doesn't matter, and you can use leading
zeroes if you want to.

#### Sample Input 1
```
18
```

#### Sample Output 1
```
1122
1202
1210
2002
2010
10002
10010
```

#### Sample Input 2
```
73
```

#### Sample Output 2
```
112121
112201
120121
120201
121001
200121
200201
201001
1000121
1000201
1001001
```

## Advanced - Chester, the Greedy Pomeranian
__*Source*__: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3629st/20150515_challenge_214_hard_chester_the_greedy/

Chester is a very spirited young Pomeranian that lives in a pen that exactly
covers the unit square. He's sitting in the middle of it, at (0.5, 0.5), minding
his own business when out of nowhere, six of the most delicious dog treats you
could ever imagine start raining down from the sky.<br>

The treats land at these coordinates:
```
(0.9, 0.7) (0.7, 0.7) (0.1, 0.1)
(0.4, 0.1) (0.6, 0.6) (0.8, 0.8)
```

In the end, he's eaten the treats in this order:
```
(0.6, 0.6), (0.7, 0.7), (0.8, 0.8)
(0.9, 0.7), (0.4, 0.1), (0.1, 0.1)
```

Since he started at (0.5, 0.5), he will have travelled a total distance of roughly
1.646710... units.<br>
Your challenge today is to calculate the total length of Chester's journey to eat
all of the magically appearing dog-treats.


A small note - distance is calculated using the standard plane distance formula.
That is, the distance between a point with coordinates (x1, y1) and a point with
oordinates (x2, y2) is equal to:

```
sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)
```

#### Input
The first line of the input will be an integer N that will specify how many treats
have magically appeared. After that, there will follow N subsequent lines giving
the locations of the treats. Each of those lines will have two floating point
numbers on them separated by a space giving you the X and Y coordinate for that
particular treat.<br>
Each number provided will be between 0 and 1. Except for the first sample, all
numbers will be rounded to 8 decimal digits after the period.
Note that most of the inputs I will provide will be in external text files, as
they are too long to paste into this description. The bonus input, in particular,
is about 2 megabytes large.

#### Output

You will output a single line with a single number on it, giving the total length
of Chester's journey. Remember that he always starts at (0.5, 0.5), before going
for the first treat.


#### Sample Input 1
```
6
0.9 0.7
0.7 0.7
0.1 0.1
0.4 0.1
0.6 0.6
0.8 0.8
```

#### Sample Output 1
```
1.6467103925399036
```

#### Sample Input 2
