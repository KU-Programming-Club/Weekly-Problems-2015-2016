# Week 1 - 2015 September 2

## Beginner 1

This one should be informative if you've had very little programming experience thus far. You should create a program which asks the user for their name, and then responds with a friendly greeting. For example,

```
What's your name?
> John Doe
Hello, John Doe!
```

If you're looking for inspiration on a language to use, here's a basic tutorial for [Java](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2853/Java-Basics-Input-and-Output) and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/).

## Beginner 2

Create a program that checks if a word is a [palindrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)â€”that is, a word which is spelled the same when its letters are reversed, such as "noon" or "racecar". Capitalization of letters isn't important. Just check if the letters would be the same if reversed.

```
> Noon
Palindrome
> racecar
Palindrome
> Groot
Not a palindrome
```

## Advanced

This problem comes from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/), a neat website filled with mathematically-oriented programming challenges. This problem is actually [problem 16](http://projecteuler.net/problem=16) from Project Euler in disguise, so if you're so inclined, you can create a Project Euler account, submit your solution, and earn points! Yeah!

Anyway, your goal is to find the sum of the digits of a rather large number. For example, 2^15 = 32678, so the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26. What is the sum of the digits of 2^1000? 2^10000? 2^100000?
