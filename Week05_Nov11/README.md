# Week 5 - 2015 November 11


## Beginner - Evaluating e<sup>x</sup>
__Source__: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/eval-ex

The series expansion of ex is given by:

1 + x + x<sup>2</sup>/2! + x<sup>3</sup>/3! + x<sup>4</sup>/4! + .......

Evaluate e^x for given values of x, by using the above expansion for the first 10
terms. The challenge is to accomplish this without either mutable state, or direct
declaration of local variables.

#### Input Format

The first line contains an integer number N which will be the number of test cases.
N lines follow, each line containing a value of x for which you need to output the
value of e<sup>x</sup> using the above series expansion.These input values have
exactly 4 decimal places each.

#### Output Format

N lines, each of them containing the value of e<sup>x</sup>, computed by your program.

#### Sample Input
```
4
20.0000
5.0000
0.5000
-0.5000
```

#### Sample Output
```
2423600.1887
143.6895
1.6487
0.6065

## Intermediate 1 - Scoring a Bowling Game
__Source__: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3ntsni/20151007_challenge_235_intermediate_scoring_a/


You'll be given a bowling sheet for a single person on a line, with the ten frames
separated by a space. All scores are single characters: - for zero (aka a gutter
ball), 1-9 for 1-9 pins knocked down, / for a spare, and X for a strike. If you
see any two digit numbers (e.g. "63") that's actually the first and second ball
scores (a six then a three). Example:

```
X X X X X X X X X XXX
```

Your program should calculate the score for the sheet and report it. From our example:

```
300
```

Aka a perfect game.

#### Challenge Input
```
X -/ X 5- 8/ 9- X 81 1- 4/X
62 71  X 9- 8/  X  X 35 72 5/8
```

#### Challenge Output
```
137
140
```

## Intermediate 2 - Fallout Hacking Game
__Source__: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3qjnil/20151028_challenge_238_intermediate_fallout/


The popular video games Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas have a computer "hacking"
mini-game where the player must correctly guess the correct password from a list of
same-length words. Your challenge is to implement this game yourself.<br>
The game operates similarly to the classic board game Mastermind. The player has
only 4 guesses and on each incorrect guess the computer will indicate how many
letter positions are correct.<br>
For example, if the password is MIND and the player guesses MEND, the game will
indicate that 3 out of 4 positions are correct (M_ND). If the password is COMPUTE
and the player guesses PLAYFUL, the game will report 0/7. While some of the letters
match, they're in the wrong position.<br>
Ask the player for a difficulty (very easy, easy, average, hard, very hard),
then present the player with 5 to 15 words of the same length. The length can
be 4 to 15 letters. More words and letters make for a harder puzzle. The player
then has 4 guesses, and on each incorrect guess indicate the number of correct
positions.

#### Example
```
Difficulty (1-5)? 3
SCORPION
FLOGGING
CROPPERS
MIGRAINE
FOOTNOTE
REFINERY
VAULTING
VICARAGE
PROTRACT
DESCENTS
Guess (4 left)? migraine
0/8 correct
Guess (3 left)? protract
2/8 correct
Guess (2 left)? croppers
8/8 correct
You win!
```

You can draw words from this dictionary file: [enable1.txt](http://code.google.com/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads/detail?name=enable1.txt). Your
program should completely ignore case when making the position checks.<br>
There may be ways to increase the difficulty of the game, perhaps even making it
impossible to guarantee a solution, based on your particular selection of words.
For example, your program could supply words that have little letter position
overlap so that guesses reveal as little information to the player as possible.

## Advanced - Divisible by 7
__Source__: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3irzsi/20150828_challenge_229_hard_divisible_by_7/

Consider positive integers that are divisible by 7, and are also divisible by 7
when you reverse the digits. For instance, 259 counts, because 952 is also
divisible by 7. The list of all such numbers between 0 and 10<sup>3</sup> is:
```
7 70 77 161 168 252 259 343 434 525 595 616 686 700 707 770 777 861 868 952 959
```
The sum of these numbers is 10,787.<br>
Find the sum of all such numbers between 0 and 10<sup>11</sup>.

#### Challenge Input

Make your program work for an upper limit of 10<sup>N</sup> for any N, and be
able to efficiently handle N's much larger than 11.
