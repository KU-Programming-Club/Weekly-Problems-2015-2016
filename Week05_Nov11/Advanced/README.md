__Source__: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3irzsi/20150828_challenge_229_hard_divisible_by_7/

Consider positive integers that are divisible by 7, and are also divisible by 7
when you reverse the digits. For instance, 259 counts, because 952 is also
divisible by 7. The list of all such numbers between 0 and 10<sup>3</sup> is:
```
7 70 77 161 168 252 259 343 434 525 595 616 686 700 707 770 777 861 868 952 959
```
The sum of these numbers is 10,787.<br>
Find the sum of all such numbers between 0 and 10<sup>11</sup>.

#### Challenge Input

Make your program work for an upper limit of 10<sup>N</sup> for any N, and be
able to efficiently handle N's much larger than 11.
